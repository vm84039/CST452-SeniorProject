                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Welcome to my Grand Canyon University Senior Project portfolio page. My project is an application that features a collection of
                    graphical games created in the Laravel Framework.  Games will include hangman,
                    tic-tac-toe, and peg.  The application will have realistic gameplay for each game and will correctly determine the game outcome.  Win loss records
                    will be recorded and the application will allow users to register to keep track
                    of their gaming record. Users will play against another player or computer.<br><br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The web application will feature a login and registration page which will be protected with Laravel's OAuth security.  There will be an
                administration controls where an admin can suspend or delete user's account, add and delete words from the hangman game, and create more admin users.

                <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please check out my biography and other applications that I have worked on at GCU.<br>
