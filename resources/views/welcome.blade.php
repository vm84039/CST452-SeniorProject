                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Welcome to my Grand Canyon University Senior Project portfolio page. My project is an application that features a collection of
                    graphical games created in the Laravel Framework.  Games will include hangman,
                    tic-tac-toe, and peg.  Cognitive games are great for cognitive development.  For example, tic-tac-toe is a game of predictability.
                The game objective forces a player to predict a players next move and try to block them.  Peg forces a player to strategize their moves
                until there are as few pegs left in the triangle.
                Cognitive games have been proven to increase development in children, increase memory, and sustain development in seniors.
                From a Christian Worldview perspective.  Games are a proven to have many benefits in the structure of a family and oneself.
                Skills that are learned while playing games are turn-taking, teamwork, patience, structure of rules, and overall have fun as a family.<br><br>


                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The application will have realistic gameplay for each game and will correctly determine the game outcome.  Win loss records
                    will be recorded and the application will allow users to register to keep track
                    of their gaming record. Users will play against another player or computer.  The web application will feature a login and registration page which will be protected with Laravel's OAuth security.  There will be an
                administration controls where an admin can suspend or delete user's account, add and delete words from the hangman game, and create more admin users.<br>
